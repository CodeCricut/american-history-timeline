The Puritans established a fur trade with nearby Indian tribes, but it was an uneasy one; Puritans saw Indians as lazy savages who simply accepted their life in nature without making an effort to conquer it. Eventually, rivalry over control of the trade and opposition to English territorial expansion led to the Pequot War. The Pequot, Puritans, and surrounding tribes fought back and forth for a while, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of people on all sides. In 1638, the Treaty of Hartford ended the war. The war virtually wiped out the Pequot, and the ones who remained were sometimes forced into praying towns where they assimilate to Puritan culture.\",\r\n        summary:\r\n            \"Puritans in New England had many differences with the Pequot Indians living in the area which eventually led to the Pequot War in 1636.

Even so, many white Southerners saw them as uncivilized savages who could never fully assimilate. Between 1827 and 1830, the states of Georgia, Mississippi, and Alabama dissolved the Indian governments and seized their lands. In a Supreme Court decision, John Marshall ruled that the seizure was unconstitutional. President Jackson, who favored states rights, ignored the decision and said that the decision was up to the states. Jackson also urged Congress to pass the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which would move the tribes from their homes in the southeast to the west. Only the Choctaws and Chickasaws agreed to the migration. The Cherokees did not officially agree, but U.S. soldiers forced 16,000 Cherokees to walk from their lands to Oklahoma along the Trail of Tears. At least 4,000 Cherokees died on this journey. A similar thing happened with the Creek Indians. In Florida, the Seminoles fought the Second Seminole War. In the end, American troops forced most Seminoles to leave their lands. In the Midwest, a chief named Black Hawk led the resistance by the Sauk and Fox nations in what became known as Black Hawk’s War.
