Even so, many white Southerners saw them as uncivilized savages who could never fully assimilate. Between 1827 and 1830, the states of Georgia, Mississippi, and Alabama dissolved the Indian governments and seized their lands. In a Supreme Court decision, John Marshall ruled that the seizure was unconstitutional. President Jackson, who favored states rights, ignored the decision and said that the decision was up to the states. Jackson also urged Congress to pass the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which would move the tribes from their homes in the southeast to the west. Only the Choctaws and Chickasaws agreed to the migration. The Cherokees did not officially agree, but U.S. soldiers forced 16,000 Cherokees to walk from their lands to Oklahoma along the Trail of Tears. At least 4,000 Cherokees died on this journey. A similar thing happened with the Creek Indians. In Florida, the Seminoles fought the Second Seminole War. In the end, American troops forced most Seminoles to leave their lands.
